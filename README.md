# Buster

A canvas-rendered IDE built from scratch with Tauri, Rust, and SolidJS.

Every character on screen — code, terminal, UI — is drawn on an HTML Canvas. No DOM text anywhere. The editor uses a TypeScript string[] buffer backed by SolidJS signals, Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting, and Pretext for text measurement. The terminal runs a real PTY through a VT100 parser in Rust and renders the cell grid on canvas. The whole app ships as an 11 MB installer.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70+)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (1.0+)
- On macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- On Linux: see [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hightowerbuilds/buster.git
cd buster
bun install
bun run tauri build
```

The built app will be at:
- macOS: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Buster.app`
- macOS DMG: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Buster_0.1.0_x64.dmg`

### Development

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

This starts the app with hot-reload for the frontend. Rust changes trigger an automatic rebuild.

## Usage

### Getting started

Open Buster. The welcome screen shows an ASCII particle animation. Open the command palette (**Cmd+Shift+P**) and run "Start Guided Tour", or open a folder from the sidebar to start editing.

### Features

**Editor** — Canvas-rendered with a TypeScript string[] buffer (SolidJS signals). Syntax highlighting via Tree-sitter for 100+ languages. Code folding, find/replace with regex, minimap, multi-cursor editing, word wrap, virtual scrolling, AI ghost text completions. Large files (50 MB+) are streamed on demand. Markdown preview mode for .md files. Image viewer for PNG, JPG, GIF, and WebP.

**Terminal** — Full terminal emulator rendered on canvas. VT100/ANSI parsing in Rust via the vt100 crate with sixel image support. Supports NeoVim, htop, tmux, and anything else that runs in a terminal. Mouse reporting, bracketed paste, scrollback history, configurable themes. Each terminal opens as a tab alongside your files.

**AI Agent** — Chat with Claude (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5), Ollama (local), Codex (OpenAI), or Gemini (Google). The agent can read files, write code, search the codebase, and run commands in your workspace. State-changing tools require user approval. Configurable rate limits for tool calls, writes, and commands. Model gallery with card-flip UI for browsing and queuing models. API keys stored securely per provider.

**Git & GitHub** — 30 built-in git commands with no terminal required. Status, staging, commit (with amend), push/pull/fetch, branches, stash, remote management, blame overlay, diff gutter indicators, conflict resolution, and a canvas-rendered commit graph with colored lanes. Browse GitHub PRs and issues directly in the editor via the gh CLI.

**LSP** — Language server support for Rust (rust-analyzer), TypeScript/JavaScript (typescript-language-server), Python (pyright), and Go (gopls). Autocomplete, hover, signature help, code actions, inlay hints, go-to-definition, document symbols, rename refactoring, find all references, and a diagnostics panel with automatic crash recovery.

**Debugger** — DAP-based debugging. Set breakpoints (with conditions), launch programs, step over/into/out, pause, and inspect stack frames and variables. Works with any Debug Adapter Protocol server.

**Quick Open** — Cmd+P opens a fuzzy file search across your workspace. Respects .gitignore. Prefix modes: `>` commands, `:` go-to-line, `@` symbols, `#` content search, `?` AI.

**Find & Replace** — Cmd+F with regex support, match highlighting, case sensitivity toggle, replace one or replace all.

**Layouts** — Panel layout modes: Tabs, Columns, Grid, Trio, Quint, Rerack, and HQ (3x2 grid). Draggable dividers between panels.

**File Explorer** — Sidebar with lazy-loading directory tree. Respects .gitignore. Drag and drop files between folders. Right-click context menu with rename, delete, copy path.

**Session Restore** — Auto-saves every 30 seconds. Hot-exit on window close. Restores workspace, tabs, cursor positions, and dirty buffers on relaunch.

**Extensions** — WASM-sandboxed extensions with capability-based permissions. Extensions can render custom UI surfaces via display list commands, control embedded browser webviews, and connect via WebSocket or HTTP SSE gateways to external services. Three working Rust extensions exist: an embedded browser with devtools, a pixel art editor, and a prompt stacker.

**Guided Tour** — An 11-step canvas-animated tutorial that teaches every feature including git and AI integration. Each step assembles as ASCII particle text.

### Why these choices

**SolidJS** over React — No virtual DOM. Fine-grained reactivity means signals update only what changed. 7 KB runtime.

**Tauri** over Electron — Rust backend with native webview. 11 MB installer instead of 800 MB. Lower memory usage. Direct access to system APIs.

**Canvas** over DOM — Every character is drawn via Canvas 2D. Pretext measures text 600x faster than DOM layout. No reflow, no style recalculation.

**TypeScript string[]** over Rust IPC — Zero-latency edits with no IPC per keystroke. SolidJS signals provide reactive updates. Undo/redo with time-based grouping.

**vt100 + Canvas** over xterm.js — Removed 333 KB of JavaScript. Terminal state lives in Rust. Rendering goes through the same canvas pipeline as the editor.
