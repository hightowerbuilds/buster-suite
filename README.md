# Buster

A canvas-rendered IDE built from scratch with Tauri, Rust, and SolidJS.

Every character on screen — code, terminal, UI — is drawn on an HTML Canvas. No DOM text anywhere. The editor uses a TypeScript string[] buffer backed by SolidJS signals, Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting, and Pretext for text measurement. The terminal runs a real PTY through a VT100 parser in Rust and renders the cell grid on canvas.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70+)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (1.0+)
- On macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- On Linux: see [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hightowerbuilds/buster.git
cd buster
bun install
bun run tauri build
```

The built app will be at:
- macOS: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Buster.app`
- macOS DMG: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Buster_0.1.0_x64.dmg`

### Development

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

This starts the app with hot-reload for the frontend. Rust changes trigger an automatic rebuild.

## Usage

### Features

**Editor** — Canvas-rendered with a TypeScript string[] buffer (SolidJS signals). Syntax highlighting via Tree-sitter for 20+ languages. Code folding, find/replace with regex, minimap, multi-cursor editing, word wrap, indent guides, bracket pair colorization, Emmet abbreviation expansion for HTML/CSS. Image viewer for PNG, JPG, GIF, and WebP.

**Terminal** — Full terminal emulator rendered on canvas. VT100/ANSI parsing in Rust via the vt100 crate with sixel image support. Runs any PTY program — NeoVim, htop, tmux, etc. Mouse reporting, bracketed paste, scrollback history with search, configurable themes, crash recovery. Each terminal opens as a tab alongside your files.

**Git** — 30+ built-in git commands with no terminal required. Status, staging, commit (with amend), push/pull/fetch, branches, stash, remote management, blame overlay, diff gutter indicators, conflict resolution, and a canvas-rendered commit graph with colored lanes.

**LSP** — Language server support for Rust (rust-analyzer), TypeScript/JavaScript (typescript-language-server), Python (pyright), and Go (gopls). Autocomplete, hover, signature help, code actions, inlay hints, go-to-definition, go-to-type-definition, document symbols, rename refactoring, find all references, and a diagnostics panel with automatic crash recovery.

**Debugger** — DAP-based debugging. Set breakpoints (with conditions), launch programs, step over/into/out, pause, and inspect stack frames and variables. Works with any Debug Adapter Protocol server.

**Quick Open** — Cmd+P opens a fuzzy file search across your workspace. Respects .gitignore. Prefix modes: `>` commands, `:` go-to-line, `@` symbols, `#` content search.

**Find & Replace** — Cmd+F with regex support, match highlighting, case sensitivity toggle, replace one or replace all.

**Layouts** — Split panels up to 6 ways with draggable dividers between panels.

**File Explorer** — Sidebar with lazy-loading directory tree. Respects .gitignore. Drag and drop files between folders. Right-click context menu with rename, delete, copy path.

**Session Restore** — Auto-saves every 30 seconds. Hot-exit on window close. Restores workspace, tabs, cursor positions, and dirty buffers on relaunch.

**Extensions** — WASM-sandboxed extensions with capability-based permissions. Extensions can render custom UI surfaces via display list commands, control embedded browser webviews, and connect via WebSocket or HTTP SSE gateways to external services.

### Why these choices

**SolidJS** over React — No virtual DOM. Fine-grained reactivity means signals update only what changed.

**Tauri** over Electron — Rust backend with native webview. Fraction of the install size. Lower memory usage. Direct access to system APIs.

**Canvas** over DOM — Every character is drawn via Canvas 2D. No reflow, no style recalculation.

**TypeScript string[]** over Rust IPC — Zero-latency edits with no IPC per keystroke. SolidJS signals provide reactive updates. Undo/redo with time-based grouping.

**vt100 + Canvas** over xterm.js — Terminal state lives in Rust. Rendering goes through the same canvas pipeline as the editor.
